 * This means that imx_dma_buffer_unmap() must be called exactly the same number of times
 * imx_dma_buffer_map() was called on the same DMA buffer in order to be actually unmapped.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Attempts to map an already mapped buffer with different read/write flags are
 * only valid if the new flags are a strict subset of the old flags. For example, if the
 * buffer was already mapped with the read and write flags, and another, redundant mapping
 * attempt is made with only the read flag, then this is valid. Another example: If the buffer
 * was already mapped, but with the read flag only, and another, redundant mapping attempt is

 * undefined behavior. This function, along with imx_dma_buffer_stop_sync_session(),
 * establishes a "session" in which it is guaranteed that coherency will be established
 * at the beginning and the end of the session. At the start, the CPU cache will be
 * repopulated with the contents of the underlying memory region (if the cache is stale)
 * if the IMX_DMA_BUFFER_MAPPING_FLAG_READ flag was passed to imx_dma_buffer_map().
 * When the session stops, the contents of the CPU cache are written to the underlying
 * memory region if the IMX_DMA_BUFFER_MAPPING_FLAG_WRITE flag was passed to
 * imx_dma_buffer_map(). That way, reading from DMA memory and writing to DMA memory
 * both can be done without breaking cache coherency.
 *
 * Normally, users do not need to call this, since the map and unmap functions will
 * do this automatically. If IMX_DMA_BUFFER_MAPPING_FLAG_MANUAL_SYNC was passed to
 * imx_dma_buffer_map() though, mapping and unmapping will _not_ automatically
 * handle the sync, and users have to call imx_dma_buffer_start_sync_session() and
 * imx_dma_buffer_stop_sync_session() manually. This can be useful if synchronization
 * needs to happen sometime while the buffer is mapped, for example if the buffer
 * is (un)mapped as part of a device initialization / shutdown. In such cases, the
 * buffer needs to stay mapped, but cache coherency may have to be maintained at
 * some point.
